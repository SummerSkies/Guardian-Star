# Guardian-Star
My Personal Capstone Project!
This is a WIP app for a point-and-click escape room style puzzle game. 
The project will be finished when I have created a proper demo for what could be a full scale game, if I had the resources. This way, it would be a proper show of my skills without being far too large of a project for only me to finish. Its main purpose is to help fill my portfolio and to refine my Mobile Development skills.

## Plot Summary
There are two great forces in this world: The Stars and the Void. The Stars were made by the Divines to protect earth from the Void. However, the Void can still slip through the cracks between the Stars-- and if it does, it will target the fragile soul of a fear-sensitive child.
You were made to stop this from happening.
You are what is known as a Guardian Star-- A Star that was sent to protect a child who is being plagued by the Void. Guardian Stars place themselves inside their child's favorite toy and bring it to life. This way, they can go where the child goes, while actively warding them against the Void.

## Game Summary
You are a Guardian Star, who has taken the form of a doll named Susie. Your child is a young girl by the name of Daisy. During a game of hide-and-seek, you feel Daisy slipping into unease and paranoia, and you know she is in danger. 
You must make your way through the large and spacious house back to Daisy's room. But this may prove to be difficult-- after all, you're only a doll. A house built for humans will have many unlikely obstacles for you.
Whatever you do, you must hurry! Every second is precious. If you're too late, Daisy will be lost to the Void.
